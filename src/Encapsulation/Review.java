	 *   a.static binding/ early binding , compile time polymorphism ---> method overloading 
	 *   b.dynamic binding / late binding, run time polymorphism ---> method overriding
	 * 4.Encapsulation
	 * to achive encapsulation :
	 * 1. the variables inside the class should be private
	 * 2. provide getter and setter method to modify and view the variable values
	 * (read only access ---> only getter methods are implemented
	 * i.e. getter methods have a return type.
	 * (write only access ---> only setter methods are implemented
	 * i.e. setter method do not have a return type.
	 * 
	 * data hiding
